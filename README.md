# Test task 

### Was built using Kiwi API, which is blocked for non-registered users with no affiliate ID...

#### The test version can be deployed on your own based on Telegram as long as you have own Telegram bot API token

### NOTE: Do not forget create creds.py file and put your API TOKEN there

#### MORE TO DOS:
- Migrate to Redis
- Connect the SQL database
- Clean yaml
- Clean a code 
- Take a solution of rebuilding using webhooks
- Reloop the code with more usability (e.g. add buttons for looping)
